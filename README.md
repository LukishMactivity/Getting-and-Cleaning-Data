# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
## Practical assignment Coursera week 4
Here you'll find two files: `analysis.R` script with included commentary, and  `codebook.md` provides an overview of the procedure and variable descriptions explaining the attributes of the column names.

Here is the code to read the tidy.txt file into your 'R' environment: `tidydata <- read.table("tidy.txt", header = TRUE)`

You will notice the data is tidy as there is only one variable per column.  Also The first 'Actvity' variable has been given descriptive character names in place of the original numeric values.  Also, see the codebook for a clear desciptive brekadown of the remaining column names.
